class QueryProcessor(ABC):
    """Queries must implement this class.

    - Queries are instantiated *once* per flow run,
      and the same query instance is passed to all
      subflows. Therefore, you can store internal state
      in the query, for example querying for all sources
      when given the process root command, and then using
      those sources in subsequent invocations.

    - Queries are passed the full BranchState at every
      invocation, but should never write to this state

    - Queries are passed a parser instance with a number
      of higher level functions to search for flow inputs
      and outputs, but access to making raw ET queries
      is still possible. Never write to the parser
      instance.

    - Examine the documentation for the parser instance.

    **CAUTION** The parser and BranchState API is still
    in development, so early queries may break on upgrade,
    until a more formal release is made, at which point
    older APIs will be maintained for backwards compatability.

    Please stay in contact with the project developers if you are writing
    custom queries or would prefer additional parser functionality.

    - do not rely on _methods in the parser being stable
      across even minor releases.
